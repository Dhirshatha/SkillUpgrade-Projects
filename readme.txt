Sentiment analysis Task 1 :

Sentiment analysis using Python involves analyzing text data to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind the words.

This technique is often used in analyzing customer reviews, social media posts, and feedback to gauge public opinion or customer satisfaction.

Using algorithms and machine learning, the system analyzes the content of an image and assigns it to a specific category, such as identifying whether an image contains a cat, dog, or another object. This technology is widely used in applications like facial recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles.
